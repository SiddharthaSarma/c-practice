# STL
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

STL has four components
- Containers
- Iterators
- Algorithms
- Functors

## Containers
Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standard “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.

1. Sequence containers
    - [ ] vector
    - [ ] pair
    - [ ] list
    - [ ] deque
    - [ ] arrays
    - [ ] forward list
2. Container Adapters
    - [ ] stack
    - [ ] priority queue
    - [ ] queue
3. Associate/Ordered containers
    - [ ] set
    - [ ] multiset
    - [ ] map
    - [ ] multimap
4. Unordered Associative containers
    - [ ] unordered_set
    - [ ] unordered_multiset
    - [ ] unordered_map
    - [ ] unordered_multimap
